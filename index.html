        <h3 id="headline">Here is a brief overview of how James Harrison became the "Baby Saver":</h3>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><strong>Life: Dec 27th 1936 - February 17th 2025</strong></li>
            <li>
                <strong>1954: At age 14, James underwent major surgery requiring lots of donated blood. This inspired him to begin donating blood.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Soon after he began donating blood, it was discovered his blood contained rare antibodies to the D Rh group antigen.</strong>
                <p>When an unborn baby has tested positive for D Rh antigens and their mother is negative, this can result in serious sickness, disabilities, and stillbirth. Through his donations of plasma, he has been able to provide over 2 million babies the antigens required to overcome such outcomes.</p>
