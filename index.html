      <h3 id="headline">Here is a brief overview of how James Harrison became the "Baby Saver":</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Life: Dec 27th 1936- February 17th 2025</strong> </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1954: At age 14, James underwent major surgery requiring lots of donated blood. This inspired him to begin donating blood.</strong> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soon after he began donating blood, it was discovered his blood contained rare antibodies to the D Rh group antigen</strong>
        <p> When an unborn baby has tested positive for D Rh antigens and their mother is negative, this can result in serious sickness, disabilities, and stillbirth. Through his donations of plasma, he has been able to provide over 2 million babies the antigens required overcome such outcomes.
